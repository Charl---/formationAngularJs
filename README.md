ng-start
==================

Simple seed project for AngularJS apps.
  - NO backend
  - NO SASS/LESS
  - NO Twitter Bootstrap
  - NO fancy language (CoffeeScript, Jade...)
  - NO Yeoman
I don't imply that you shouldn't use any of those, but they are simple enough to add to justify letting them clutter the seed.

Here's what you get out of the box :
  - Gulp
  - Karma
  - Protractor
  - Sample code demonstrating how to test AngularJS components and apps
  - JSHint
  - Live Reload (using browser plugin)
  - UI Router
  - No need to add a script tag in your index.html for every JavaScript file you write

Useful gulp tasks :
  - dev (default) - runs dev server and watches for changes (livereload)
  - tdd - karma with watchers
  - atdd - protractor with watchers
